    "Volleyball is one of the most interactive games going. It is a game of intuition, imagination, 
    improvisation - but most of all, of reciprocity - of teamwork. There is no way to free-lance 
    in volleyball." -Marv Dunphy

        History
      </h1>
      <p>
        On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (USA), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education
        director, created a new game called Mintonette as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by 
        any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball. A match 
        was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number 
        of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents’ court.
